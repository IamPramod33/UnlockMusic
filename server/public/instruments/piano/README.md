Piano instrument samples

Place per-note files here for the Western scale player.

Expected filenames (MVP):
- Use 'sharp' in filenames instead of '#':
- C4.mp3, Csharp4.mp3, D4.mp3, Dsharp4.mp3, E4.mp3, F4.mp3, Fsharp4.mp3, G4.mp3, Gsharp4.mp3, A4.mp3, Asharp4.mp3, B4.mp3

Notes
- For cross-platform (web + iOS + Android), prefer .mp3 (or .m4a). Safari/iOS have limited .ogg support.
- Keep files short (<= 1s), normalized, and trimmed to avoid clicks.
- You can also provide both .mp3 and .ogg and add a fallback in the player if desired.
