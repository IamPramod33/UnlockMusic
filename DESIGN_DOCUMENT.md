- Implement a theming system (Light/Dark) using the palette in 4.3 and ensure baseline accessibility

Deliverables
- Navigation
  - Public stack: `Login`, `Register`, `ForgotPassword`, `ResetPassword`
  - Private stack: Bottom tabs `Home`, `Learn` (placeholder), `Profile`
  - Fallback `NotFound` screen and guarded routes tied to auth state
- Screens (V1)
  - `HomeScreen`: Simple welcome, role-aware admin action visible only to admins
  - `ProfileScreen`: View/edit name and skill level; show email and role; show preferences snapshot
  - `SettingsScreen`: Toggle theme (light/dark), select language, audio quality; persists in store
  - `LearnScreen` (placeholder): stub for future lessons
  - `NotFoundScreen`: generic 404 within app container
- UI Components
  - `ScreenContainer`, `Header`, `Button`, `Input`, `Loader`, `Alert`, `EmptyState`
  - Theme tokens (spacing, colors, radius, typography) and `useTheme` hook
- Theming & Responsiveness
  - Light/Dark theme mapped from section 4.3 palette
  - Breakpoints: xs (<360), sm (360-599), md (600-959), lg (>=960)
  - Web: centered max-width container (e.g., 1200px), mobile-first layout
- Accessibility (baseline)
  - Minimum touch target 44x44
  - Sufficient color contrast per WCAG AA
  - Semantic roles/ARIA for web inputs/buttons; visible focus outlines on web

Task Breakdown
- Frontend
  - Add bottom tab navigator and route guards using the global auth store
  - Build `HomeScreen`, `ProfileScreen`, `SettingsScreen`, `LearnScreen`, `NotFoundScreen`
  - Implement theme context/provider with Light/Dark; connect to preferences in store
  - Extract shared UI primitives and spacing/typography scale
  - Implement responsive containers and platform-specific tweaks for web/mobile
- Backend

  - Optional: add `/api/health` for uptime checks
- Design
  - Quick wireframes for 5 screens and tab layout
  - Define icon set (react-native-vector-icons) and placeholder illustrations

Acceptance Criteria
- Guarded navigation reliably switches Public ↔ Private based on auth state
- Bottom tabs render on mobile and web, with icons and labels
- Layout adapts without horizontal scroll at common breakpoints; web uses centered max width
- Theme toggle updates UI instantly and persists in store; applied across all screens
- Profile allows editing name and skill level and reflects saved state
- Settings updates preferences (theme, language, audio quality) in store; changes survive reload
- Basic accessibility: focus outlines on web, labels on inputs, color contrast meets AA

Runbook (Solo Dev)
- Prereqs: Backend running on port 4000; client configured with `API_URL`
- Start
  - Server: `npm run dev:server` (root) or `cd server && npm run dev`
  - Client: `npm run dev:client` (root) or `cd client && npm run start`
- Test

- Manual QA checklist
  - Login → tabs appear; logout → auth screens appear
  - Switch theme; reload app; theme persists
  - Change name/skill; revisit Profile; values persist
  - Resize browser from 320px to 1440px; no layout breaks

  - Public: `LessonListScreen` (filters + search), `LessonDetailScreen` (shows lesson with exercises)
  - Admin: `ContentListScreen` (tabs: Lessons, Exercises), `LessonEditorScreen`, `ExerciseEditorScreen`
  - Navigation: add an Admin-only entry to Content screens (from Settings or Admin area)
- Filtering & Search
  - Client-side controls for music system, difficulty, category; search by title (client-side contains text match, server filter via `title` optional when added)

Task Breakdown

  - Build `LessonDetailScreen` to display content and exercises
  - Build admin list (paginated or simple lists) for lessons/exercises
  - Build simple editors with text inputs/selects for required fields; call admin CRUD
  - Add Admin-only navigation entry (visible only if `user.role === 'admin'`)

Acceptance Criteria
- Admin can create, edit, delete a lesson with required fields and see it appear in public list
- Admin can add exercises to a lesson and see them on the lesson detail view
- Non-admin users can list lessons, filter by musicSystem/difficulty/category, and view details
- Search by lesson title filters results on the client; no errors for empty queries
- All admin endpoints require valid auth and admin role; invalid payloads return 400

Runbook (Solo Dev)
- Prereqs: Server running, admin user available (seeded `admin@example.com`)
- Create sample lessons
  - Admin login → use Admin Content → create a Western and a Carnatic lesson with different difficulties
  - Add 1–2 exercises to each lesson
